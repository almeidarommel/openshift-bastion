## Prerequisites Preparation

The following services are pre-requisites for OpenShift 4.2+ installation 
- RESOURCES
- NETWORK
- DNS

### Minimum resource requirements

### Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

**All machines to all machines**

### NETWORK TOPOLOGY REQUIREMENTS
The infrastructure that you provision for your cluster must meet the following network topology requirements.

[NOTE]
===
OpenShift Container Platform requires all nodes to have internet access to pull images for platform containers and provide telemetry data to Red Hat.
===

**Load balancers** 
Before you install OpenShift Container Platform, you must provision two layer-4 load balancers. The API requires one load balancer and the default Ingress Controller needs the second load balancer to provide ingress to applications.

### ETHERNET ADAPTOR HARDWARE ADDRESS REQUIREMENTS
When provisioning VMs for the cluster, the ethernet interfaces configured for each VM must use a MAC address from the VMware Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) allocation ranges:

00:05:69:00:00:00 to 00:05:69:FF:FF:FF

00:0c:29:00:00:00 to 00:0c:29:FF:FF:FF

00:1c:14:00:00:00 to 00:1c:14:FF:FF:FF

00:50:56:00:00:00 to 00:50:56:FF:FF:FF

If a MAC address outside the VMware OUI is used, the cluster installation will not succeed.

### Required DNS records

##### Set your DNS spreedsheet

|Component	
|Record	
|Description

|Kubernetes API
|api.<cluster-id>.<base_domain>
|This DNS record must point to the load balancer for the control plane machines. This record must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

|Kubernetes API
|api-int.<cluster-id>.<base_domain>
|This DNS record must point to the load balancer for the control plane machines. This record must be resolvable from all the nodes within the cluster.The API server must be able to resolve the worker nodes by the host names that are recorded in Kubernetes. If it cannot resolve the node names, proxied API calls can fail, and you cannot retrieve logs from Pods.

|Routes
|*.apps.<cluster-id>.<base_domain>
|A wildcard DNS record that points to the load balancer that targets the machines that run the Ingress router pods, which are the worker nodes by default. This record must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

|etcd
|etcd-<index>.<cluster-id>.<base_domain>
|OpenShift Container Platform requires DNS records for each etcd instance to point to the control plane machines that host the instances. The etcd instances are differentiated by <index> values, which start with 0 and end with n-1, where n is the number of control plane machines in the cluster. The DNS record must resolve to an unicast IPv4 address for the control plane machine, and the records must be resolvable from all the nodes in the cluster.

|etcd
|_etcd-server-ssl._tcp.<cluster-id>.<base_domain>
|For each control plane machine, OpenShift Container Platform also requires a SRV DNS record for etcd server on that machine with priority 0, weight 10 and port 2380. A cluster that uses three control plane machines requires the following records:
